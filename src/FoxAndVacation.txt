This kingdom is full of lovely cities.
During her stay Ciel would like to visit as many different cities as possible.

EXAMPLES

0)
5
{2,2,2}

Returns: 2

Fox Ciel's vacation lasts for 5 days. She needs at least 2 days to visit each of the cities, so she can visit at most 2 of them.

1)
5
{5,6,1}

Returns: 1

She can only visit one city: either city 0, or city 2.

2)
5
{6,6,6}

Returns: 0

This time the poor Fox Ciel cannot visit any city during her summer vacation.

3)
6
{1,1,1,1,1}

Returns: 5

In this test case Ciel can visit all five cities.
Note that at the end of her trip each city either does count as visited, or it does not -- there is no way to "visit" the same city twice.

4)
10
{7,1,5,6,1,3,4}

Returns: 4



5)
50
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15}

Returns: 9



6)
21
{14,2,16,9,9,5,5,23,25,20,8,25,6,12,3,2,4,5,10,14,19,12,25,15,14}
