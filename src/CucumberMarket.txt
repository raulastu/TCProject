PROBLEM STATEMENT

Cucumber Boy is young and loves cucumbers.  Therefore, Cucumber Boy will go to the cucumber market to buy some cucumbers.

Different cucumbers may have different costs.  For each i, buying the i-th cucumber (0-based index) costs price[i] yen.

Cucumber Boy's mother gave him budget yen.  However, he does not understand money well.
He just chooses some k unique cucumbers he likes.  If the total price of the chosen cucumbers is not greater than budget yen, he can buy them, otherwise he cannot.

You are given the int[] price, the int budget and the int k.  Your method must return "YES" (quotes for clarity) if Cucumber Boy can buy any set of k unique cucumbers, and "NO" if there is some set of k cucumbers that is too expensive for him.

1110
3

There are 4 choices.

If he chooses cucumbers 0, 1, and 2, the total price will be 1000+1+10 = 1011 yen.
If he chooses cucumbers 0, 1, and 3, the total price will be 1000+1+100 = 1101 yen.
If he chooses cucumbers 0, 2, and 3, the total price will be 1000+10+100 = 1110 yen.
If he chooses cucumbers 1, 2, and 3, the total price will be 1+10+100 = 111 yen.

The result is "YES", because Cucumber Boy can buy any set of k unique cucumbers.


1)
{1000,1,10,100}
1109
3

Returns: "NO"

This case is the same as the example 0, except for the value of budget. 

If he chooses cucumbers 0, 2, and 3, the total price will be 1000+10+100 = 1110 yen.
 1110 yen is greater than the budget therefore the result is "NO".
