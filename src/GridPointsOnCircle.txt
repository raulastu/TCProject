PROBLEM STATEMENT

You will be given rSquare, the square of the radius of a circle.
You are to return the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates)
that lie on the circumference of a circle with this radius centered at the
origin of the (cartesian) coordinate system.



DEFINITION
Class:GridPointsOnCircle
Method:countPoints
Parameters:int
Returns:int
Method signature:int countPoints(int rSquare)


CONSTRAINTS
-rSquare will be between 1 and 2,000,000,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
1

Returns: 4

A circle with radius 1 centered at the origin goes through 4 lattice points: (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0) and (0,-1).

1)
25

Returns: 12

A circle with radius 5 goes through the points (+/-3, +/-4), (+/-4, +/-3), (0, +/-5) and (+/-5, 0) (12 points).

2)
3

Returns: 0

No lattice point is at distance sqrt(3) from the origin.

3)
44

Returns: 0

4)
50

Returns: 12
