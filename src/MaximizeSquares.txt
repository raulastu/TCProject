PROBLEM STATEMENT
Consider an arrangement of N points on the cartesian plane. The "square count" of the points is the total number of distinct squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes which can be built using 4 different points as vertices.  Your task is to return the maximum square count, considering all possible arrangements of N points on the plane.

DEFINITION
Class:MaximizeSquares
Method:squareCount
Parameters:int
Returns:int
Method signature:int squareCount(int N)


NOTES
-Two squares are distinct if at least one of their corners is in a different location.


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 0 and 1000000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
4

Returns: 1

Clearly, we can only make one square out of 4 points.

1)
5

Returns: 1

No matter where we place a fifth point, we can't get any extra squares.

2)
6

Returns: 2

We can get 2 squares by placing the points in the shape of a rectangle.

3)
16

Returns: 14



4)
115

Returns: 340
