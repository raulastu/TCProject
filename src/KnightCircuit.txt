PROBLEM STATEMENT
The (a,b)-knight is a chess piece that moves by jumping, just as a regular knight, but the jump is a cells in one direction, b in the other. Formally, an (a,b)-knight standing on the cell (x,y) can move to any of the following eight cells:
(x+a,y+b), (x+a,y-b), (x-a,y+b), (x-a,y-b), (x+b,y+a), (x+b,y-a), (x-b,y+a), and (x-b,y-a).
Of course, if the (a,b)-knight is close to the edge of the board, some of these cells might not be on the board.
It is not allowed to jump to a cell that is not on the board.

A knight circuit is a sequence of cells on a chess board that starts and ends with the same cell.
Each consecutive pair of cells in the knight circuit must correspond to a single jump of the (a,b)-knight.
The knight circuit may visit each cell arbitrarily many times.
The size of a knight circuit is the number of different cells visited by the circuit.

You are given the ints w and h: the width (in columns) and the height (in rows) of a rectangular chessboard. You are also given the ints a and b: the parameters of your knight. Return the maximum knight circuit size that can be obtained on the given board. You are free to choose any cell as the start of your circuit.
