PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are playing a card game.
In the card game, each card holds a magic spell with two properties: its level and its damage.
During the game, you will play some of the cards (possibly none or all of them) to attack your enemy.



Initially, there are n cards.
The cards are placed in a row and they are labeled from 0 to n-1, in order.
You are given two int[]s: level and damage.
For each i, the level of card i is level[i], and its damage is damage[i].



In each turn of the game, you can pick a card to play.
You can only pick card i if there are at least another (level[i]-1) cards to the right of it.
Picking a card with level L and damage D has the following effects:

Your opponent receives D damage.
Starting with this card, L cards are discarded. 
That is, if the chosen card was card i, then the discarded cards are cards i to (i+L-1), inclusive.




Return the maximal total damage you can deal to your opponent.
